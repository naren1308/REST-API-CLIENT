This Java application fetches real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap using HTTP requests and parses the JSON response to display structured weather details such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. The program establishes an HTTP connection, retrieves the JSON response, and processes it using the org.json.JSONObject library. The structured output is printed to the console in a user-friendly format. Tools and Libraries Used Java SE (Standard Edition) is used as the core language for writing and executing the program. Eclipse IDE serves as an integrated development environment for writing, debugging, and running Java code. OpenWeatherMap API is a public REST API used to fetch real-time weather data. HttpURLConnection is Java's built-in HTTP client for making GET requests to APIs. org.json Library (json-20210307.jar) is a third-party library used for parsing and handling JSON responses. By integrating external APIs, this application demonstrates how Java can interact with online services to retrieve and process dynamic data.
